# Plinth Web

This npm package is part of my Plinth stack (See example at [Plinth-Hello-World](https://github.com/gusjengis/Plinth-Hello-World).)

This is where I'll put any typescript or CSS that I feel is worth making common between all Plinth projects.

Currently it just contains the styling that properly sizes and places the wgpu canvas.
